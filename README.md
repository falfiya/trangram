*Programming puzzles and competitive programming related media*

*Programming: The Job* and *Programming: The Technical Interview* seem to be two separate skills. It's a common internet opinion that these two don't have a lot of overlap. So complicit in my own incompetence, I refused to practice programming puzzles.

Occasionally, during my own projects, I'd encounter a difficult algorithmic problem. Usually, it'd take a long time to solve. I brushed it off as an irregularity. One day, I opened up LeetCode and read [352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/data-stream-as-disjoint-intervals/description/). It was eerily familar. I must have encountered something like this in one of my own projects at some point.

Maybe it's time to stop being stubborn. Learning how to do programming puzzles will help get me hired and it'll also help me think better. Plus, they're sometimes kind of fun actually! So instead of thinking about them as something I *have to do* in order to be hired, I'll approach them a little more openly.
